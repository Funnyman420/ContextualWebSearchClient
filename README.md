</div>

I wanted to use the free [ContextualWebSearch API](https://contextualweb.io/) and I realized that C# had no apparent client. If there is and I missed it... **Oh well**.  

The API consists of 5 types of functionalities and naturally, so does my client.  

* Auto Complete
* Image Search
* News Search
* Spell Check
* Web Search

## More Information

The folder [Docs](https://github.com/Funnyman420/ContextualWebSearchClient/tree/master/docs) contains all you need to know about the library.
